# Keyring API Architecture

## Terminology

Let's introduce some terminology used across the Keyring API:

- **Blockchain account**: An object in a single blockchain, representing an
  account, with its balance, nonce, etc.

- **Request**: A request sent by a dapp to MetaMask.

- **Keyring account**: Is an account model that represents one or more
  blockchain accounts.

- **Account Snap**: A Snap that implements the Keyring API.

- **Keyring Snap**: Same as Account Snap.

- **Keyring request**: A request from MetaMask to an account Snap to perform an
  action on, or using, a keyring account. It wraps the original request sent by
  the dapp and adds some metadata to it.

## System context diagram

In most use cases, we will encounter the following systems when interacting
with an account managed by an account Snap:

```mermaid
graph TD
  User -->|Uses to submit requests<br/>and manage accounts| MetaMask
  User -->|Starts requests| Dapp
  User -->|Uses to manage<br/>requests and accounts| Site
  Dapp -->|Submits requests| MetaMask
  Site[Snap Companion Dapp] -->|Manages requests<br/>and accounts| MetaMask
  MetaMask -->|Submits requests and<br/>manages accounts| Snap
  Snap -->|Notifies about account<br/>and request events| MetaMask
```

- **User**: The web3 user interacting with the dapp, the Snap companion dapp,
  and MetaMask.

- **Dapp**: The web3 application that is requesting an action to be performed
  on an account.

- **MetaMask**: The web3 provider that dapps connect to. It routes requests to
  the account Snaps and lets the user perform some level of account management.

- **Snap**: A Snap that implements the Keyring API to manage the user's
  accounts, and to handle requests that use these accounts.

- **Snap Companion Dapp**: The Snap's UI component that allows the user to
  interact with the Snap to manage accounts and requests.

## Components diagram

This components diagram shows the internal components of MetaMask and **can be
ignored by account Snap developers.**

## Snap installation

The account creation flow is the initial process that a user will encounter
when using an account Snap. It can be initiated by the "Add account Snap"
button in MetaMask's accounts list or by the Snap companion dapp.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
autonumber

actor User
participant MetaMask
participant Snap
participant Site as Snap Companion Dapp

alt Optional
  User ->>+ MetaMask: Add new account Snap
  MetaMask ->> MetaMask: Display suggested Snaps
  User ->> MetaMask: Select Snap
  MetaMask ->> Site: Open in a new tab
  deactivate MetaMask
end

Site ->>+ MetaMask: Install Snap?
MetaMask ->> MetaMask: Display permissions dialog
User ->> MetaMask: Approve permissions
MetaMask -->>- Site: OK
```

## Account creation

Once your account Snap is installed, the user can use the Snap companion dapp
to create or import accounts.

```mermaid

autonumber

actor User
participant MetaMask
participant Snap
participant Site as Snap Companion Dapp

User ->>+ Site: Create new account
Site ->> Site: Custom logic to create account
Site ->>+ Snap: keyring_createAccount(options?)
Snap ->> Snap: Custom logic to create account
Snap ->>+ MetaMask: snap_manageAccounts("notify:accountCreated", account)
User ->> MetaMask: Approve account creation
MetaMask -->>- Snap: OK
Snap -->>- Site: OK
Site -->>- User: Done
```

## Transaction flows

The Keyring API supports two different types of flows for handling requests:
synchronous and asynchronous. The choice of which flow to implement depends on
the use case of the account Snap.

In general, the asynchronous flow should be used when the request requires user
interaction or when the request will take a long time to complete. The
synchronous flow should be preferred for any other use case.

### Asynchronous transaction flow

In the asynchronous transaction flow, MetaMask sends a keyring request to the
account Snap, and the account Snap responds with a `{ pending: true, redirect?
}` response to indicate that the keyring request will be handled
asynchronously. This response can optionally contain a `redirect` URL that
MetaMask will open in a new tab to allow the user to interact with the keyring
Snap companion dapp.

Once the account Snap has completed the request, it sends a notification to
MetaMask with the result of the request.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
autonumber

actor User
participant Dapp
participant MetaMask
participant Snap
participant Site as Snap Companion Dapp

User ->>+ Dapp: Create new sign request
Dapp ->>+ MetaMask: ethereum.request(request)
alt Is EIP-4337 account?
  MetaMask ->>+ Snap: keyring_prepareRequest(request)
  Snap ->> Snap: Custom logic to prepare request
  Snap -->>- MetaMask: { request }
end
MetaMask ->> MetaMask: Display request to user
User ->> MetaMask: Approve request

MetaMask ->>+ Snap: keyring_submitRequest(request)
Snap ->> Snap: Save request to Snap's state
Snap -->>- MetaMask: { pending: true, redirect? }
alt There is a redirect URL
  User ->> MetaMask: Acknowledge redirection
  MetaMask ->>+ Site: Open redirect URL in a new tab
end
deactivate MetaMask

Site ->>+ Snap: keyring_getRequests(id)
Snap -->>- Site: request

Site ->> Site: Custom logic to handle request
Site ->>+ Snap: keyring_approveRequest(id, data?)
Snap ->> Snap: Custom logic to handle request
Snap ->>+ MetaMask: snap_manageAccounts("notify:requestApproved", { id, result })

MetaMask -->> Dapp: result
MetaMask -->>- Snap: OK
Snap -->>- Site: OK
deactivate Site

Dapp -->>- User: Done
```

### Synchronous transaction flow

In the synchronous transaction flow, MetaMask sends a keyring request to the
account Snap, and the account Snap responds with a `{ pending: false, result }`
response that contains the result of the request.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
autonumber

actor User
participant Dapp
participant MetaMask
participant Snap

User ->>+ Dapp: Create new sign request
Dapp ->>+ MetaMask: ethereum.request(request)
alt Is EIP-4337 account?
  MetaMask ->>+ Snap: keyring_prepareRequest(request)
  Snap ->> Snap: Custom logic to prepare request
  Snap -->>- MetaMask: { request }
end
MetaMask ->> MetaMask: Display request to user
User ->> MetaMask: Approve request

MetaMask ->>+ Snap: keyring_submitRequest(request)
Snap ->> Snap: Custom logic to handle request
Snap -->>- MetaMask: { pendind: false, result }

MetaMask -->>- Dapp: result

Dapp -->>- User: Done
```
